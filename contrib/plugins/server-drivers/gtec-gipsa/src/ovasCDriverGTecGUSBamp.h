	 * \class CDriverGTecGUSBamp
	 * \author Anton Andreev, Gipsa-lab, VIBS team
	 * \date 19/07/2012
	 * \brief GTEC driver
	 *
	 * This driver was rewritten to match the code provided by Guger as much as possible. There are several things
	 * that all must work together so that higher frequencies are supported and no hardware triggers are lost.
	 *
	 * This driver supports several buffers so that the more than one GT_GetData can be executed in the beginning (QUEUE_SIZE)
	 * and then calls to GT_GetData are queued. This allows data to be processed by OpenVibe while waiting for the next result of
	 * a previously issued GT_GetData. The extra thread is added to support this and to allow for async IO. 
	 *
	 * Hardware triggers on the parallel port are supported.
	 *
	 * This driver also sets the current process to higher priority when started and reverts to normal when stopped. 
	 *
	 * It can also set the GTEC thread (the one that fills the ring buffer with data from the amplifier) to higher priority, but 
	 * you should enable this according to your needs.
	 *
	 * The driver supports several g.tec devices working with the provided async cables. There are several requirements for async
	 * acquisition to work properly and these are checked in verifySyncMode().
