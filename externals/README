|OVERVIEW|

 This directory can be used if you have external modules designed for OpenViBE
 that you want to include within your OpenViBE build but not necessarily
 contribute. Contributed components should go to contrib/.

|LAYOUT|

 Each subdirectory of the externals directory will be candidate for building 
 in the build scripts. It must conform to the usual OpenViBE directory layout.

 For example you create an application "app" based on OpenViBE, and this application uses
 a collection of plugins "app-plugs". You might then have the following layout :

 openvibe-externals/
   + my-app/
       + doc/
       + ...
       + src/
       + CMakeLists.txt
   + my-app-plugs/
       + doc/
       + ...
       + src/
       + CMakeLists.txt

|BUILDING|

 Running the usual build should include the folders in external/
 automatically. If it doesn't, please delete local-tmp/ and try again.
