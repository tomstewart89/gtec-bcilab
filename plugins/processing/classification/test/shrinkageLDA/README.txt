Some (toy) materials to test the shrinkage LDA.

The data were created by createData.R

Running the example scenarios in Designer should illustrate how the shrinkage LDA behaves better in a situations where there's too few training examples for accurate covariance estimation.

Todo: proper automatic tests, e.g. verify that accuracy in some real-data scenario stays above a threshold.
