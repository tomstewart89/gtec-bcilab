Detailed description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Description|
 * This box allows to restrict outgoing signal data to a subset of incoming data based on a list of channels.
 * Channels may be identified by their index, their name (the case matters), or a mix of both. Additionally,
 * the channels can be rejected instead of being selected.
 * The name of the box displayed in the designer is the channel list (first setting). It allows the user to see directly if the box configuration is correct.
 * However, should the user chose to rename the box manually, further change in the configuration won't be reflected in the name, except if the name is set 
 * back to its default value.

Inputs description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Inputs|
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Inputs|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Input1|
 * The input matrix which channels should be selected or rejected. The type of this input can be changed to
 * signal or spectrum depending on what kind of stream channel to select.

Outputs description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Outputs|
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Outputs|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Output1|
 * The output matrix with selected or preserved channels. The type of this output can be changed to
 * signal or spectrum depending on what kind of stream channel to select.

Settings description

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Settings|
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Settings|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Setting1|
 * A semi colon separated list of channel identifiers. You can use the index of the channel or the name of the
 * channel. Also, ranges can be selected specifying first channel identifier, followed by a colon, followed by
 * the second channel identifier.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Setting1|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Setting2|
 * The action to perform on the identifier channel, be it selection or rejection.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Setting2|

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Setting3|
 * The kind of identification for channel list.
 * - \c Smart let the box try to detect if the channel identifier is an index or a name
 * - \c Name forces the channel identifiers to be considered as channel names. This can be useful if channel names are numbers.
 * - \c Index forces the channel identifiers to be considered as channel indices. This can be useful if channel names are numbers.
 * |OVP_DocEnd_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Setting3|

Examples description
__________________________________________________________________

 * |OVP_DocBegin_BoxAlgorithm_ChannelSelector_Examples|
 * Suppose you want to select the first 8 channels of an input stream, plus you want the Cz electrode. You would then use
 * the following string : "1:8[SEMICOLON]Cz", where you replace [SEMICOLON] with the actual semicolon character (that we are unable
 * to print here due to bug in CMake).
