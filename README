Brain-Computer Interfaces. This document provides basic

|Repository.organisation|

The project repository is composed of several software modules. Each software
module can have its own branches and tags and is compiled separately
from other modules. The repository basically looks like this :

root of the repository
 + <openvibe> (API / specifications)
 + <kernel> (kernel implementation)
 + <toolkit> (development help components)
 + <applications> (OpenViBE user applications)
    + <platform>
        + <acquisition-server>
        + <designer>
    + ...
 + <plugins> (OpenViBE plugin collections)
    + <samples>
    + <acquisition>
    + ...
 + <modules> (abstraction and portability components)
    + <ebml>
    + <socket>
    + ...
 + <contrib> (third-party components, author retains code ownership)
    + ...
	
Each software module is organized as a UNIX-like tree (empty folders not
included):

+ <bin> (any pre-compiled binaries)
+ <include> (target folder for API headers)
+ <lib> (any pre-compiled libraries)
+ <share> (shared file folder for all data)
+ <src> (source code of the module)
+ <doc> (documentation files for the module)
+ <test> (unit test source code for the module)
