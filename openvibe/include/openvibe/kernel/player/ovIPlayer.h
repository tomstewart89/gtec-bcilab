		 * \brief The main player class
		 * \ingroup Group_Player
		 * \ingroup Group_Kernel
		 *
		 * A player is responsible for the playback of a specific scenario.
		 * This player scenario is provided at initialisation stage and should
		 * not be changed until the player terminates. The player idea of calling
		 * a "play" function forces the use of threads in order to avoid CPU locking.
		 * Thus we prefer the idea of having a "short-time" function that is to be
		 * called repeatedly until the player terminates. This is the role of the
		 * \c IPlayer::loop function, that should be called repeatedly by the outside
		 * application.
		 *
		 * \todo Refactor this base class to propose an interface
		 *       more OpenViBE compliant (use IDs, intialize/unitialize
		 *       pairs etc...)
