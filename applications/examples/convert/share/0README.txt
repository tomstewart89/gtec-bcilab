These scenarios illustrate how to convert files from one file format to 
another. They can be used from Designer or by 'openvibe-convert' script. 
When used from Designer, the reader and writer boxes must be configured 
with the input and output filenames required.

*** WARNING *** 

These conversions may not work correctly for all possible input and 
output combinations. For example, an .ov file may have several streams, 
a situation which may not be supported by some other format. On the 
other hand, .ov files can not contain multiple streams with different 
sampling rates. Some other data, like experiment information, may not 
translate between formats properly or at all.

You may have to customize each scenario to your particular case and 
study the results to discover the possible limitations that may exist.
