	 * \class CSpaceshipBCI
	 * \author Laurent Bonnet (INRIA/IRISA)
	 * \date 2010-02-16
	 * \brief Ogre application for the application "Use-The-Force".
	 *
	 * \details The SpaceshipBCI application is based on motor imagery of the feet. 
	 * The 3D scene is a hangar, with few barrels stored. 
	 * A spaceship is parked on the center of the screen.
	 * The subject has to move his feet to lift the spaceship.
	 * The feedback is computed according to the bounce of beta 
	 * detected in the EEG, after the movement.
	 * 
	 * Each trial has 3 steps:
	 * - Rest: the subject has to stand still.
	 * - Move: the subject moves his feet.
	 * - NoMove: the subject stops.
	 * The subject scores if the spaceship is lifted in the NoMove phase.
