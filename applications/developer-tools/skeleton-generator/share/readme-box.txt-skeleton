******************************************************
* Thanks for using the OpenViBE Skeleton Generator ! *
******************************************************

File generation completed
[@@Date@@]
-------------------------

The generator produced the following files:

The Box class:
- ovpCBoxAlgorithm@@ClassName@@.h
- ovpCBoxAlgorithm@@ClassName@@.cpp
Please put these files in your local repository, in the project of your choice (e.g. Signal Processing or Classification)
     [openvibe-repository]/contrib/plugins/[plugin-project]/src/[my-box-folder]
 
You may have to change the file ovpCBoxAlgorithm@@ClassName@@.h to make it find the included file ovp_defines.h, whose path is related to the project used.
 
Don't forget to declare your box in ovp_main.cpp, in order to make it available in the Designer.
Look in one of the ovp_main.cpp file, you will find examples of such declarations (#include the header, then OVP_Declare_New macro). 
This look something like this:

#include "[my-box-folder]/ovpCBoxAlgorithm@@ClassName@@.h"

...

OVP_Declare_Begin();

...

OVP_Declare_New(OpenViBEPlugins::@@Namespace@@::CBoxAlgorithm@@ClassName@@Desc);
...

OVP_Declare_End();


If your box doesn't appear in the designer, maybe it's because you cannot see Unstable Boxes.
Try to set your configuration file (openvibe.conf on windows / .openviberc on Linux) with the following token :
>>>>>
Designer_ShowUnstable = true
>>>>>
