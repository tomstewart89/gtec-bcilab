	 * \brief Helper to write basic EBML types
	 *
	 * This class may be used by the user in order to correctly
	 * format simple types defined in the EBML description such
	 * as integers, floats, strings etc... It directly uses the
	 * EBML::IWriter connected instance so one could simply
	 * use the helper in order to write his EBML stream.
	 *
	 * A similar class exists to help parsing process...
	 * See EBML::IReaderHelper for more details.
	 *
	 * Be sure to look at http://ebml.sourceforge.net/specs/ in
	 * order to understand what EBML is and how it should be used.
