	 * \brief EBML formating class
	 *
	 * This class is used in order to format datas using EBML
	 * specifications. It gives a minimalistic interface to
	 * allow creating new EBML nodes, and to insert data
	 * in simple child nodes.
	 *
	 * Basic usage of this class consists in :
	 *
	 *  - Create child node
	 *  - Gives information about the node :
	 *    - Whether created node is master node
	 *        (Goto 1)
	 *    - Whether created node is simple child node
	 *        (set data for this child node)
	 *  - Close opened node
	 *
	 * The EBML::IWriterHelper class could be used in order
	 * to send EBML standard data such as integers, floats,
	 * strings, etc...
	 *
	 * To create instances of this class, the user has to call
	 * EBML::createWriter. To delete instances of this class, the
	 * user has to call EBML::IWriter::release.
	 *
	 * Be sure to look at http://ebml.sourceforge.net/specs/ in
	 * order to understand what EBML is and how it should be used.
